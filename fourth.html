<h2>File Path System: The First Principle and Core Problem
</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h2>
<pr>The most fundamental truth is this: A website is not one single file.

It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are organized into folders, just like documents on your computer.

</pr>
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: The Core Problem</h2>
<pr>Now we have a core problem: If your index.html file needs to display an image named logo.png, how does the HTML file tell the browser where to find logo.png?

You can't just say src="logo.png" and expect it to work every time. What if the logo is in an images folder? What if it's on a completely different website?

The browser needs an exact, unambiguous address to locate the file. A file path is that address.

</pr>
<hr>
<h2>A) Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h2>
<pr>A relative file path gives directions to a file starting from the location of the file you are currently in. You will use this 99% of the time for linking your own files together (images, CSS, other HTML pages).

<h2>Scenario 1: Linking to a file in the SAME folder</h2>
<pr>The Problem: You are in index.html and want to link to about.html.

The Logic: Both files are in the same folder (my-website/), so the path is just the filename.
